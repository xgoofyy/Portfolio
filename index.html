        <p>Hard-working and persistent programmer currently in my senior year interested in pursuing software and computer engineering, programming, and related education. I am always looking to expand my knowledge of any language. 

        Currently, I am working on projects related to machine learning and AI, Arduino/robotics, and application development. In the future, I hope to learn about and partake in projects related to web development as well as learn C++.</p>
